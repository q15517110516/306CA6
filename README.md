# CA6 Music
Some quick points:

1. Document your code.  Use markdown cells to describe your song and what your code is doing.

2. Your code doesn't have to be beautiful.  Some clumsiness is fine.  Just make sure it works.

3. Also, this isn't a music class, but it is a signal processing class.  I'm interested in interesting signal processing ideas.
